## The study of Social Cognition

Social Cognition is the study of how people represent and manipulate their worlds.  Our group uses cognitive and behavioural techniques to examine some of the most puzzling, and most important, human phenomena, including religious belief and prayer, facial attractiveness, social categorization, among many others. This lab is a part of the Department of Psychology of the University of Otago, directed by Professor Jamin Halberstadt.
